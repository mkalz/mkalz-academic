title: Technology to improve learning. A public engangement project.
abstract: We invite you to a public project that engages Primary, Secondary, and
  Post-secondary education administrators, policy makers and researchers to
  translate education research into practice. We will adopt an interactive panel
  format where findings from research are highlighted by research experts, and
  visioning for translation and implementation are co-constructed through
  interaction between the expert panels and the invited participants. We will
  use research about human learning to motivate policies that advance technology
  for learning; promote a more functional orientation towards education; and
  realize advancements in current learning environments. Administrators and
  policy makers are invited to engage with leading world class researchers
  across areas of technology enhanced learning to accelerate the path from
  research into real educational impact through practice. This workshop will
  highlight key research areas, explore feedback, engage challenges from
  administrators and policy people, and use visioning to accelerate practical
  strategies. This discussion lays the foundation for documents, resources, and
  activities to move the conversation forward. The workshop is sponsored by the
  International Alliance to Advance Learning in a Digital Era, a not-for-profit
  alliance of over 3,000 researchers worldwide dedicated to learning and
  technology and the scientific advancement and practical understanding of how
  learners learn, how to teach, and how technology can support education.
