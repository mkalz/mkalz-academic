abstract: "We invite you to a public project that engages Primary, Secondary, and Post-secondary education administrators, policy makers and researchers to translate education research into practice. We will adopt an interactive panel format where findings from research are highlighted by research experts, and visioning for translation and implementation are co-constructed through interaction between the expert panels and the invited participants. We will use research about human learning to motivate policies that advance technology for learning; promote a more functional orientation towards education; and realize advancements in current learning environments. Administrators and policy makers are invited to engage with leading world class researchers across areas of technology enhanced learning to accelerate the path from research into real educational impact through practice. This workshop will highlight key research areas, explore feedback, engage challenges from administrators and policy people, and use visioning to accelerate practical strategies. This discussion lays the foundation for documents, resources, and activities to move the conversation forward. The workshop is sponsored by the International Alliance to Advance Learning in a Digital Era, a not-for-profit alliance of over 3,000 researchers worldwide dedicated to learning and technology and the scientific advancement and practical understanding of how learners learn, how to teach, and how technology can support education."
