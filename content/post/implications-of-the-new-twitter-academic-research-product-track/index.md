Twitter has recently announced that it will make the so called "full archive search" available for academic research. Until this change, it was either very costly (by paying for the enterprise version) or it took very long to build an archive of tweets (for example via the very good TAGS tool). With the new product for researchers and the advanced version of the Twitter-API (v2) it is possible to collect tweets until the first day of existence of Twitter. In this post I will briefly explain how you get started with the new option.

**Step-by-step instruction towards your corpus of tweets**

1. To get started you need first of all an account with Twitter. Since you are planning to use Twitter in your resarch I expect that you will be already using Twitter and have an account. If you have a normal account you need to apply for a developer-account with the same credentials.
2. To get a developer account, you need to [follow the application form over here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access). It is important to understand the policy that Twitter sets for its developer account and it is especially useful to understand the concept of a "use case" in their policy. A use case can be understood as a group of activities which could be repeated for a different purpose. Collecting data from the full archive search would be for example a use case. Embedding Twitter feeds into a website would be a different use-case.
3. After having received a confirmation of the accepted developer account, you can apply for the research
