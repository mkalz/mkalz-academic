abstract: "This article theorizes the functional relationship between the human
  components (i.e., scholars) and non-human components (i.e., structural
  configurations) of academic domains. It is organized around the following
  question: in what ways have scholars formed and been formed by the structural
  configurations of their academic domain? The article uses as a case study the
  academic domain of education and technology to examine this question. Its
  authorship approach is innovative, with a worldwide collection of academics
  (99 authors) collaborating to address the proposed question based on their
  reflections on daily social and academic practices. This collaboration
  followed a three-round process of contributions via email. Analysis of these
  scholars’ reflective accounts was carried out, and a theoretical proposition
  was established from this analysis. The proposition is of a mutual (yet not
  necessarily balanced) power (and therefore political) relationship between the
  human and non-human constituents of an academic realm, with the two shaping
  one another. One implication of this proposition is that these non-human
  elements exist as political ‘actors’, just like their human counterparts,
  having ‘agency’ – which they exercise over humans. This turns academic domains
  into political (functional or dysfunctional) ‘battlefields’ wherein both
  humans and non-humans engage in political activities and actions that form the
  identity of the academic domain."
