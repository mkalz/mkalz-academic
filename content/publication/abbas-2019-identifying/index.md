abstract: For predicting and improving the quality of essays, text analytic
  metrics (surface, syntactic, morphological and semantic features) can be used
  to provide formative feedback to the students. In this study, the intent was
  to find a small number of features that exhibit a fair proxy of the scores
  given by the human raters. Using an existing corpus and a text analysis tool
  for the Dutch language, a large number of features were extracted. Artificial
  neural networks, Levenberg Marquardt algorithm and backward elimination were
  used to reduce the number of extracted features automatically. Irrelevant
  features were eliminated based on the inter-rater agreement between predicted
  and human scores calculated using Cohen’s Kappa. By using our algorithm, the
  number of features in this study was reduced from 457 to 23. The selected
  features were grouped into six different categories. Of these categories, we
  believe that the features present in the groups “Word Difficulty” and “Lexical
  Diversity” are most useful for providing automated formative feedback to the
  students. The approach presented in this research paper is the first step
  towards our ultimate goal of providing meaningful formative feedback to the
  students for enhancing their writing skills and capabilities.
