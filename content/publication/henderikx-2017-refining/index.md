abstract: In this paper we present an alternative typology for determining
  success and dropout in massive open online courses (MOOCs). This typology
  takes the perspectives of MOOC-takers into account and is based on the their
  intentions and subsequent behaviour. An explorative study using two MOOCs was
  carried out to test the applicability of the typology. Following the
  traditional approach based on course completion to identify educational
  success, success rates were 6.5 and 5.6%. The success rates from the
  perspectives of the MOOC-taker were 59 and 70%. These findings demonstrate
  that merely looking at course completion as a measure for success does not
  suffice in the context of MOOCs. This change in addressing MOOC success and
  dropout provides an alternative view and demonstrates the importance of
  MOOC-takersâ€™ perspectives.
